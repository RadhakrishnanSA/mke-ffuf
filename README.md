# mke-ffuf
mke-ffuf is a revised version of ffuf built for ease of use and cleaner results. While using ffuf, the output often becomes very large, making scrolling and identifying unique responses difficult. mke-ffuf shortens and filters results automatically to highlight only meaningful and unique responses, making web fuzzing easier
